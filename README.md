## features

- bpm guessing
- slideshow and gifs synced to the beat
- videos processed server-side

these are features that i'm still unsure about:

- addons and toppings
- more ways of syncing music with video like effects and zoom-in

### effect ideas on beat

## ui design

- minimalistic
- monospace

- readable progress bar
- some kind of accent color?
- theme picker
